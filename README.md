- Using AI algorithm to analyze drone data and identify trends and patterns related to climate change
- Import libraries for data processing and machine learning
- Machine learning algorithm, a support vector machine (SVM), to analyze drone data and identify trends and patterns related to climate change

## General Methodology
1. Collect weather data using drones. This data will include temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, and precipitation.
2. Clean and format the data, so that it can be used for training and testing a machine learning model. This involves removing any outliers or missing data, and converting the data into a format that can be used with a specific machine learning library.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets. This will be used to train and evaluate the performance of the model.
4. Choosing a machine learning model algorithm that can predict weather based on the drone-gathered data. Includes simple linear regression to complex deep learning neural networks
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data. Evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the predicted results with the actual results.
6. Fine-tune the model and repeat steps 4 and 5 until a satisfactory level of accuracy is achieved.
7. Use the final model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
